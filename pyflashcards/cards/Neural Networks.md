## q
When the **artificial neuron** was first developed, what was its structure?

## a
The **aritificial neuron** had one/many binary input neurons, an activation threshold, and a single binary output. These could be structured to compute complex logic.

## q
The **perceptron** was invented in 1957. What is its structure?

## a
A **perceptron** is a simple ANN. It is composed of a single layer of **threshold logic unit** (TLU) neurons. Each TLU receives each of the numerical inputs in addition to a **bias** term (typically 1). The TLU multiplies each input by a different **weight**, sums those products, and applies a **step function**. Common step functions include:

* The **heaviside** function: 0 if sum < 0; 1 if sum >= 0
* The **sign** function: -1 if sum < 0; 0 if sum = 0; 1 if sum > 0
