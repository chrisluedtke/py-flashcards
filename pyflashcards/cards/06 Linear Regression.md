##### Question
What is a **Variance Inflation Factor**?

##### Answer
The variance inflation factor (or VIF for short), is the ratio of variance in a model with multiple terms, divided by the variance of a model with one term alone. It quantifies the severity of multicollineartiy in an ordinary least squares regression analysis. It provides an index that measures how much the variance(the square of the estimate's standard deviation) of an estimated regression coefficient is increased because of collinearity.
