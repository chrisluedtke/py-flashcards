##### Question
How do you find the **determinant** of a Matrix?

##### Answer
The determinant is a property that all square matrices possess, denoted with pipes (i.e. |A|).

The determinant can be found with the equation:
```
 A  = [[a, b]
      [c, d]]

|A| = ad - bc
```

##### Question
What is **Orthogonality**?

##### Answer
Orthogonality is the property that means 'changing A does not change B'. An example of an orthogonal system would be where we skip to the next song on our playlist, and changing the song does not change the volume.

In programming, orthogonality means that when we execute an instruction, nothing but that instruction happens.

##### Question
What is a **Linear Combination**?

##### Answer
In linear algebra, we define the concept of linear combinations in terms of vectors. But, it is actually possible to talk about linear combinations of anything...

(scalar)(something 1 ) + (scalar)(something 2) + (scalar)(something 3)

These 'somethings' could be everyday variables like x, y, z etc. or something more complicated like polynomials. A linear combination is a particular way of combining things (variables, vectors, etc.) using scalar multiplication and addition.

##### Question
What is **Collinearity**? Why can it be a problem?

##### Answer
Collineartiy is a condition in which some of the independent variables are highly correlated.

Collinearity tends to inflate the variance of at lesat one estimated regression coefficient.

##### Question
What is **Dimensionality**? Why is it important?

##### Answer
The number of rows and columns a matrix has.

Dataframes can be represented as matrix of size = dataframe.shape, and this is important to note if we are adding new features, concantenating more data, or merging two datasets together.

##### Question
What is **Singular Value Decomposition**?

##### Answer
Factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a given matrix using its constituent elements. These constituent parts help make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler.

##### Question
What is **covariance**?

##### Answer
Covariance is a measure of the directional relationship between the returns on two risky assets. A positive covariance means that asset returns move together while a negative covariance means returns more inversely.

##### Question
What is **Principal Component Analysis**?

##### Answer
Principal Component Analysis(or PCA for short), is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
