What is a **Doubly Linked List**? What is it useful for, and what are its drawbacks?

## a
**Doubly Linked Lists** are a linear data structure composed of nodes connected to both their prior and their following node.

Useful

* occupy dynamic space (as opposed to array)
* can be traversed forward and backward (as opposed to linked list)

Drawbacks

* compared to a singly linked list, each node requires more memory and is more complicated to implement due to having two pointers
