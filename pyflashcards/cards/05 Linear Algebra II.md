## Q
What is **Singular Value Decomposition**?

## A
Factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a given matrix using its constituent elements. These constituent parts help make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler.

## Q
What is **Orthogonality**?

## A
Orthogonality is the property that means 'changing A does not change B'. An example of an orthogonal system would be where we skip to the next song on our playlist, and changing the song does not change the volume.

In programming, orthogonality means that when we execute an instruction, nothing but that instruction happens.

## Q
What is a **Linear Combination**?

## A
In linear algebra, we define the concept of linear combinations in terms of vectors. But, it is actually possible to talk about linear combinations of anything...

(scalar)(something 1 ) + (scalar)(something 2) + (scalar)(something 3)

These 'somethings' could be everyday variables like x, y, z etc. or something more complicated like polynomials. A linear combination is a particular way of combining things (variables, vectors, etc.) using scalar multiplication and addition.

## Q
What is **Collinearity**? Why can it be a problem?

## A
Collineartiy is a condition in which some of the independent variables are highly correlated.

Collinearity tends to inflate the variance of at least one estimated regression coefficient.

## Q
What is **Principal Component Analysis**?

## A
Principal Component Analysis(or PCA for short), is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
